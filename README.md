# Tutor Log Tracker – Hunter Tutoring

> Real-time Google Sheets dashboard tracking late tutor lesson logs to improve reporting and accountability.

---

## ⚠️ Problem
Tutors were missing weekly lesson log submissions, which delayed reporting and hindered transparency within operations.

## 💡 Solution
Created a Google Sheets dashboard with formulas and conditional highlights that:
- Automatically flags overdue or missing logs based on date logic
- Uses color-coded alerts (🟥 overdue, 🟨 due soon, ✅ up to date)
- Provides visual summary for management weekly checks
